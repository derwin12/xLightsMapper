# xLightsMapper
Map one xlights Mapping File to Another
<br>
  Thoughts:
<ol>
<li>read in from and to rgbeffects</li>
<li>read in example mapping file if they have one (a prior one for example)</li>
<li>output a mapping file</li>
<li>do we map ALL from the source rgbeffects?? that might be overkill - how do we know what needs to map??</li>
  <li>learn from mapping files that were uploaded .. so A maps to B, weight these for future use</li>
  <li>identify models based on pixel counts, types, submodels so one can map like to like</li>
  <li>map based on horizontal vs vertical</li>
  <li>map groups to groups</li>
</ol>
